R6.5
    - Fixed permissions
    - Fixed issue with audio_effects.conf on some devices
    - Fixed removal of As*
R6.3
    - Added permissions in installer script
R6.2
    - Patch both /system/etc/audio_effects.conf AND /system/vendor/etc/audio_effects.conf to bypass those badly implemented audio mods that blindly overwrite audio_effects.conf or put an unused audio_effects.conf in /system/vendor/etc.
R6.1
    - Renamed namespace
    - Renamed Ds/DsUI to As/AsUI
    - Start from a clean rom (dirty flash) when installing this since it will not cleanup the previous version !
R5
    - Removed demo video, size reduced to 3 mb
R4
    - Fixed compatibility for Android 4.x in Ds.apk and DsUI.apk
    - Changed uuid and name of the library so it doesnt conflict with other dolby libraries (Ds and DsUI still do but will be overwritten)

    - Initial release
